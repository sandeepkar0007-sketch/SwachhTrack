# SwachhTrack
Swachh Track is a smart, web-based waste management platform designed to overcome the challenges of inefficient waste collection, poor segregation, and lack of transparency in traditional waste management systems. It integrates IoT-enabled smart bins, GPS-based waste truck monitoring, and real-time data analytics to enable cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable waste handling.

Smart bins continuously monitor fill levels and waste types, sending real-time data to a centralized website. Based on this information, waste collection trucks are dynamically routed to collect waste only from bins that require immediate attention. This prevents overflow, reduces unnecessary fuel usage, and ensures timely waste collection.

The platform offers a centralized dashboard for municipal authorities to track bin status, monitor truck movement, and analyze waste generation and recycling trends. This supports data-driven decision-making, improves operational efficiency, and ensures accountability in waste handling and disposal.

Swachh Track also promotes active citizen participation by allowing users to report overflowing bins or illegal dumping, check collection schedules, and view their environmental impact. Sanitation staff benefit from optimized routes, clear task assignments, and a safer, more organized workflow.

By combining technology, transparency, and community engagement, Swachh Track transforms waste management from a manual and reactive process into a smart, data-driven system. The solution is scalable and adaptable for cities, campuses, and communities, contributing to cleaner surroundings, improved public health, and long-term environmental well-being.
